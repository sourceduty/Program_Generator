[Program Generator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-EFrOSQR04-program-generator) is designed to assist developers by generating structured, modular code templates that can automate the creation of small, utility-focused programs. The primary goal is to deliver reusable components and programmatic templates that developers can quickly adapt, embed, or expand within larger projects. For instance, if a developer needs a script for handling user authentication in a REST API, this GPT can provide a template that includes functions for hashing passwords, creating JWT tokens, and validating user credentials. The templates come with comprehensive comments, recommended libraries, and practical examples, making it easy for developers to understand and integrate them into their workflows.

In addition to code generation, Program Generator follows a consultative approach, guiding users through a series of questions to tailor the output to their specific needs. This may involve asking the user about their preferred programming language, required libraries, or desired functionality. For example, if a user requests a logging system, Program Generator might inquire about the logging level (e.g., "DEBUG," "INFO," "ERROR") and whether log rotation or external logging services like Loggly or AWS CloudWatch are needed. Based on the responses, it produces a customized logging solution that includes setup, configuration, and sample usage. This approach helps streamline development processes, allowing developers to quickly implement functionality without needing to start from scratch.
